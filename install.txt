INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

This source code is compatible with and has been tested *only* with Mac computers.

To install OCaml Graphics,

1. In terminal, run "opam install graphics" and install any necessary 
dependencies.

2. If graphics is still not being installed, download homebrew and 
  run "brew install graphics" in terminal.

3. Download XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org/releases/index.html 

4. In the XQuartz terminal, run "opam install graphics"

5. Run the source code in terminal with "make play" to play the game, 
"make test" to test it, and "make docs" to create documentations.

6. If running the source code still does not work in terminal, do step 5 in 
the XQuartz terminal.

***Disclaimer: These were the only debugging steps that we went through to get
the graphics to work on our computers. If it does not work, then we suggest
trying on a computer that already has the OCaml Graphics library installed.
Sorry, we don't know what we're doing :(
